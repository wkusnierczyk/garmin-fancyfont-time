The font development process was as follows:

* The fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as True Type  (`.ttf`) fonts.
* The fonts were converted to bitmaps as `.fnt` and `.png` pairs using the open source command-line [`ttf2bmp`](https://github.com/wkusnierczyk/ttf2bmp) converter.
* The font sizes were established to match the Garmin Fenix 7X Solar watch 280x280 pixel screen resolution.
* The fonts were then scaled proportionally to match other screen sizes available on Garmin watches with round screens using the included [utility script](utils/generate_fonts.py).


## Build, test, deploy

To modify and build the sources, you need to have installed:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Monkey C extension](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/reference-guides/visual-studio-code-extension/).
* [Garmin Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/).

Consult [Monkey C Visual Studio Code Extension](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/reference-guides/visual-studio-code-extension/) for how to execute commands such as `build` and `test` to the Monkey C runtime.

You can use the included `Makefile` to conveniently trigger some of the actions from the command line.

```bash
# build binaries from sources
make build

# run unit tests -- note: requires the simulator to be running
make test

# run the simulation
make run

# clean up the project directory
make clean
```
